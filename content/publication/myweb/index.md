abstract: The World Wide Web has been evolving ever since its invention. The next step in this evolution being personalisation, the need of the hour is practical and efficient methods to implement the same. In this paper, we present a novel way of personalising websites by supplying the user preferences, both visual and content based, to web servers automatically. These preferences are learned by assessing user behaviour and identifying the preferences intelligently and also by explicit questionnaires. The learned user preferences are made available to the web servers when the user visits a website and the website modifies itself accordingly. By this mechanism personalisation of the World Wide Web is made possible.
