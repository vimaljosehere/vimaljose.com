abstract: A novel approach for early stage fraud detection by building a one-class classifier (OCC) for non-fraud users. We will be making use of an LSTM-autoencoder to convert the actor history, whenever available into user representations in a fixed dimensional feature space. These user representations will be used for generating the user representations of malicious users by a complimentary GAN generator and the GAN discriminator will be used as one of the final classifiers.
